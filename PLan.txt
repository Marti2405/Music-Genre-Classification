BROUILLON:


Introduction:
	
- Objective: Our research focuses on utilizing song lyrics to develop a robust music genre classification system that enhances user experience in music streaming platforms and digital libraries.
- Significance: With the exponential growth of digital music libraries, effective genre classification has become crucial in enhancing user experience and personalization in music streaming platforms. We aim to improve the accuracy of genre classification, enabling more precise music recommendations.
- Problem Statement: "Can the genre of a song be accurately predicted based solely on the analysis of its lyrical content?"


Methodology:

- Data Collection: A dataset of song lyrics with corresponding genre labels was obtained from various sources.
- Data Preprocessing: The lyrics were preprocessed to remove metadata, stopwords, and punctuation. Additionally, stemming and tokenization were performed to standardize the text data.
- Feature Engineering: Several methods were explored to represent the text data as numerical vectors, including Doc2Vec, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.
- Model Development: A neural network was designed using TensorFlow, with various architectures and activation functions tested to optimize the classification accuracy.
- Data Splitting and Evaluation: The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques like cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
